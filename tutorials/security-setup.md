# Security Setup for ELK Stack

Securing your ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) is crucial to protect sensitive data and maintain the integrity of your logging and monitoring infrastructure. This guide will walk you through the essential steps to secure your ELK stack.

## Prerequisites

- ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) is installed and running.
- Administrative access to the servers where ELK components are installed.
- Basic understanding of TLS/SSL and authentication mechanisms.

## Securing Elasticsearch

1. **Enable Built-in Security Features:**
   - Elasticsearch offers built-in security features such as authentication, authorization, and encryption. To enable these features, you need to install the Elastic Stack Basic License, which is free.

2. **Generate Certificates:**
   - Use the `elasticsearch-certutil` tool to generate certificates for securing communication between nodes and clients.
     ```bash
     /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-certutil cert --ca
     ```

3. **Configure Elasticsearch for TLS/SSL:**
   - Edit the `elasticsearch.yml` file to enable TLS/SSL for transport and HTTP layers:
     ```yaml
     xpack.security.enabled: true
     xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
     xpack.security.transport.ssl.verification_mode: certificate
     xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path: /path/to/elastic-certificates.p12
     xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.path: /path/to/elastic-certificates.p12
     xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true
     xpack.security.http.ssl.keystore.path: /path/to/elastic-certificates.p12
     xpack.security.http.ssl.truststore.path: /path/to/elastic-certificates.p12
     ```

4. **Create Native Users and Roles:**
   - Use the Elasticsearch API to create users and roles. Example:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST "localhost:9200/_security/role/my_admin_role" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
       "cluster": ["all"],
       "indices": [
         {
           "names": ["*"],
           "privileges": ["all"]
         }
       ]
     }'

     curl -X POST "localhost:9200/_security/user/my_admin_user" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
       "password": "password",
       "roles": ["my_admin_role"],
       "full_name": "Admin User",
       "email": "admin@example.com"
     }'
     ```

## Securing Logstash

1. **Enable SSL/TLS for Logstash Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Edit your Logstash configuration to use SSL/TLS. Example for a Beats input:
     ```plaintext
     input {
       beats {
         port => 5044
         ssl => true
         ssl_certificate => "/path/to/logstash.crt"
         ssl_key => "/path/to/logstash.key"
       }
     }

     output {
       elasticsearch {
         hosts => ["https://localhost:9200"]
         ssl => true
         cacert => "/path/to/ca.crt"
         user => "logstash_user"
         password => "password"
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Secure Logstash Configuration:**
   - Ensure that sensitive information such as passwords are stored securely. Use environment variables or secrets management tools.

## Securing Kibana

1. **Enable TLS/SSL for Kibana:**
   - Edit the `kibana.yml` file to enable SSL:
     ```yaml
     server.ssl.enabled: true
     server.ssl.certificate: /path/to/kibana.crt
     server.ssl.key: /path/to/kibana.key
     ```

2. **Configure Kibana to Use Elasticsearch Authentication:**
   - Update the `kibana.yml` file to use Elasticsearch authentication:
     ```yaml
     elasticsearch.username: "kibana_user"
     elasticsearch.password: "password"
     ```

3. **Enable Security Features in Kibana:**
   - Ensure that the following settings are enabled in `kibana.yml`:
     ```yaml
     xpack.security.enabled: true
     xpack.security.encryptionKey: "something_at_least_32_characters"
     ```

## Network Security

1. **Restrict Access with Firewalls:**
   - Use firewalls to restrict access to ELK stack components. Only allow trusted IP addresses to access the services.

2. **Use a VPN:**
   - Consider using a VPN for accessing your ELK stack to add an additional layer of security.

## Monitoring and Auditing

1. **Enable Audit Logging:**
   - Enable audit logging in Elasticsearch to track access and changes:
     ```yaml
     xpack.security.audit.enabled: true
     xpack.security.audit.outputs: [ index, logfile ]
     ```

2. **Monitor Logs and Alerts:**
   - Set up monitoring and alerting for suspicious activities. Use Kibana's alerting features to create alerts based on specific criteria.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can significantly enhance the security of your ELK stack. Ensuring proper authentication, authorization, and encryption will help protect your data and maintain the integrity of your logging and monitoring infrastructure.
